and the source code and modles can be founded here.

The website was based on Django web framework and partially was made with JSON in the Video scrolling part and was run though locally on my PC and through Cloudflare Web Tunnel

Renderings are not in realtime but a video pre-rendered in Blender and time with the user scolling a mouse wheel
